Hello forst of all IM sUBHANKAR sHAW, Ive completed my btech in 2022, then I got an offer from Cognizant. At first I did a training for 6 months then I got deployed as a java backend.
Over there I was part of a notification team where we developed a real time application using redis cache. The tech stack we used was java Spring boot and as of out data base we used redshift which is a sequal data base; Then after that due to some personal issue I had to dropoff but during that time I joined scaler for upscaling, and now when Iam ready again I applying for interviews
